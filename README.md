# Data Cleaning
The dataset have a lot of empty roles which I took care of. I removed some of unwanted columns, and added some that aided me in my analysis e.g survivor and fatality rate columns or measures. I changed the data types suitable for analysis. Separated the date columns into days, months, and year using dax formular.
