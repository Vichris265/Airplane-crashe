# Airplane-crash Analysis
An analysis of the total number of crash that occurred between 1908 to 2009
# Data Source 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurograndi/airplane-crashes-since-1908
# Data Cleaning
The dataset have a lot of empty roles which I took care of. I removed some of unwanted columns, and added some columns that aided me in my analysis e.g survivor and fatality rate columns or measures. 
I changed the data types suitable for analysis. Separated the date columns into days, months, and year using dax formular(=format, =year).
I performed a simple analytical calculations that showed percentage survivor and fatality rate by simply using the DIVIDE dax formulae.
